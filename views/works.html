      She used ideas about things that had happened to her. Her paintings are
      often shocking in the way they show pain and the harsh lives of women,
      especially her feelings about not being able to have children. Fifty-five
      of her 143 paintings are of herself. She was also influenced by native
      Mexican culture, shown in bright colors, with a mixture of realism and
      symbolism. Kahlo's work is sometimes called "surrealist", and although she
      organized art shows several times with European surrealists, she herself
      did not like that label. Her attention to female themes, and the
      honesty in her painting them, made her something of a feminist cult figure
      in the last decades of the 20th century.
