        Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈfɾiða
        ˈkalo]; 6 July 1907 – 13 July 1954[1]) was a Mexican painter known for
        her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and
        artifacts of Mexico. Inspired by the country's popular culture, she
        employed a naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity,
        postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society.[2] Her
        paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism
        with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary
        Mexicayotl movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo
        has been described as a surrealist or magical realist.[3] She is known
        for painting about her experience of chronic pain.[4]
